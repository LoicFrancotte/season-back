## Documentation

The Swagger documentation for this API is available at the following address: 
[Swagger Documentation](https://season-app-hbxam.ondigitalocean.app/swagger)

To test all the routes in the API, you need an access token. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Create an account using the `/register` route.
2. After successful registration, you will receive an access token.
3. In Swagger, click on the `Authorize` button at the top right of the page.
4. Paste your access token in the `value` field and click `Authorize`.
5. You can now test all the routes in the API with your authorized token.

Note: The access token may expire after a certain period of time. If that happens, you will need to log in again using the `/login` route to obtain a new token.
